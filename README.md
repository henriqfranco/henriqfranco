## Sup

I'm a backend-leaning dev who actually cares about reading documentation.

Currently building:

[Ekhytera](https://github.com/Ekhytera) – a smart computer assembly assistant for college  
SGIMP – scientific initiation project (think frontend, requests, and optimization)

### Tech-wise, here's what I vibe with:

#### Backend
- Node.js + Express – my go-to backend stack  
- JWT for keeping things secure  
- PostgreSQL & MySQL for storage

#### Frontend
- React + Tailwind – clean, fast, minimal  
- Also cool with TypeScript, React Router, and the classics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

#### Tools I use daily
- Vite, Git & GitHub
- Postman for API testing
- Nodemon so I don’t have to press restart

#### Other things in my toolbox
- Python for problem solving and LeetCode marathons  
- Arduino, because I started with wires before APIs  
- Photoshop for polishing things up
- Figma when I pretend to be a designer

### Right now I'm learning:
- More backend magic: authentication, databases, deployment  
- How to make backend code clean and scalable

---

### Let's talk:
Ask me about Split Keyboards, Rubik's Cubes, or backend stuff  
I’m fluent in English, Brazilian Portuguese, and JavaScript bugs
